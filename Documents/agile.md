## Intro 
This research document aims to identify the various agile methods that can be applied to a project. It provides an overview of the different methods, including their pros and cons. Additionally, it highlights the method selected for the specific project(s) and explains the reasoning behind the choice. The purpose of this research is to demonstrate my understanding of Agile method as outlined in Learning Outcome 3.

## What is Agile
"Agile" is a collection of values and principles. Working in the agile method means making every decision based on the principles and values that the team has chosen to follow. You deliver your final product in stages, continually improving the product through small releases. The project is built using sprints, allowing for the creation of changes and the ability to respond to them.[^1]. 

Better software development by valuing the items on the left more than the items on the right:
  + Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  + Working software over comprehensive documentation
  + Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  + Responding to change over following a plan.[^2]
  
There are 12 principles support those values:
  1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
  2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
  3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
  4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
  5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
  6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
  7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
  8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
  9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
  10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
  11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
  12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts accordingly

## What Agile methods are there?
These are the top 5 methods I found for Agile:
 1. SCRUM
 2. Kanban
 3. Extreme Programming (XP)
 4. Lean Development
 5. Crystal
 
## Pros and Cons of the methods
# SCRUM

Pros:
+ The scrum method promotes team motivation as the programmers are motivated to meet the deadlines for each sprint.
+ Transparent communication and project management allows all team members and even the entire organization to stay informed and involved.
+ A clear and simple "definition of done" helps to validate project requirements.
+ A strong emphasis on quality helps to minimize mistakes and improve the final product.
+ The dynamic nature of the scrum method allows developers to adjust priorities as needed, ensuring that ongoing sprints receive sufficient attention.
+ Proper sprint planning is prioritized, which helps the scrum team understand the goals, tasks, and methods involved in the project.

Cons:
+ The segmented nature of the scrum method and focus on agile development can lead to a lack of overall project perspective.
+ The scrum method may not clearly define developer roles, leading to confusion among team members.

# Kanban

Pros:
+ Allows for visualization of all tasks related to a single project using simple "cards" that can be sorted into categories such as completed, in progress, or in testing.
+ Allows for limiting the number of tasks in progress, ensuring that the team is only working on the most important or pressing tasks.
+ Focuses on the duration of each task cycle, from being added to the backlog to being completed.
+ Enables for continuous deliveries.
+ Simple and easy to implement, especially outside of the IT industry.

Cons:
+ The information shown on the Kanban board can be misinterpreted by team members, particularly if it is not kept up-to-date.
+ Since there are no timeframes in Kanban, delays may occur at various stages, causing time-related issues.

# Extreme Programming (XP)

Pros:
+ The simplicity of the written code is a benefit as it allows for easy modification and maintenance in the future.
+ XP development cycle is visible and sets clear goals for developers, resulting in relatively rapid results.
+ The methodology is highly agile due to constant testing throughout the development process.
+ XP promotes an energizing and positive working environment.
+ XP can contribute to the development and retention of team talent.

Cons:
+ The focus on code can lead to less attention being paid to design, requiring extra effort to address later.
+ May not be as effective if team members are not co-located.
+ Error tracking is not always a focus in XP projects, which can lead to recurring bugs in the future.

# Lean Development

Pros:
+ Allows the team to eliminate unnecessary activities, resulting in time and cost savings.
+ Decreases the time required to deliver functionalities by preparing the development team during the decision-making process, thereby increasing overall motivation.
+ Scalable and adaptable to projects of any size.
+ Avoids over-engineering solutions or business requirements.

Cons:
+ The success of this methodology is heavily dependent on the ability and dedication of the development team and their adherence to Lean principles.
+ Can result in losing focus as multiple tasks are divided into smaller elements.
+ Requires documentation, particularly on the characteristics of the business, to avoid errors and ensure proper development.

# Crystal

Pros:
+ Crystal methodology emphasizes frequent deliveries, which allows for early identification and resolution of issues at various stages of development.
+ There is always room for improvement, and this method encourages taking time to optimize processes and characteristics.
+ Promotes close communication within teams and fosters interaction and knowledge sharing among team members.
+ Requires a technical environment with automated tests, configuration management and frequent integration.

Cons:
+ Variations within the Crystal methodology family may result in principles that vary depending on the size of the team and the project, making the process less straightforward.
+ Geographically dispersed teams may have difficulty with the constant need for communication and reflection.
+ Planning and development are not based on requirements, which may not be suitable for some projects.
+ It's more suited for experienced and autonomous teams. [^4]

## What I chose and why
The method I have chosen for both individual and group projects is SCRUM. I chose SCRUM because I am already familiar with the method and have used it successfully in the past. It has always been an effective way to implement agile methodology in my projects. I did consider other methods, but ultimately found that SCRUM best suited my needs. The primary advantage of SCRUM is the ability to work in sprints and observe progress throughout the project. Setting realistic goals and achieving them each sprint, as well as the transparency that allows all team members to see the work of others, are major benefits of the method. Additionally, SCRUM allows for the flexibility to re-prioritize items within the project, allowing for adjustments to the project's focus as needed.
