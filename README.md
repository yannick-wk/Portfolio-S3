# Portfolio-S3 / Readers guide
This repository will be dedicated as my portfolio for S3 FHICT. The format of this repository will be developed during this semester.

## Learning outcomes
For an overview of all learning outcomes for this semester, click [here](Documents/learning-outcomes.md).

## Individual project
My project is a Medicine Reminder application where the user can set reminders for their medicine intake. The project with all the repos and other files can be found in [the Front-end Github](https://github.com/yannick-wk/Happilly-Frontend) and [on the Back-end GitHub](https://github.com/yannick-wk/Happilly-Backend).

## Group project
In this semester we're also tasked with working on a project within a group. The repository for this project can be found [here (Frontend)](https://github.com/JSchuurmans03/WoC-Frontend) and [here (Backend)](https://github.com/JSchuurmans03/WoC-Backend).

## Self-evaluation
### Web application
###### You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications

By conducting research on design and selecting the appropriate front-end tools for my project, creating user stories, establishing requirements, reviewing them, and utilizing a framework such as Quasar, I developed a full-stack web application using Quasar (Vue), C# for the back-end and Entity Framework as ORM with a PostGreSQL Database. And I have done a UX research that can be found [here](Documents/ux-research.md) I believe that I have demonstrated proficiency in this learning outcome. 

### Software quality
###### You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development

I have used tools such as Postman/Swagger to ensure that all endpoints in my system are functioning correctly and returning the appropriate data. Additionally, I have used Sonarcloud to verify the quality of my code and test automatically with an in-memory database whenever I push code and will be able to see the coverage on Sonar Cloud of the pushed code. More tests were made with JMeter and Cypress for End to End tests, Performance tests and UX tests. I have also conducted research on OWASP Security and how it was used in my project. Through these actions, I believe that I have demonstrated proficiency in this learning outcome. More on Quality Assurance [here](Documents/quality-assurance.md)

### Agile method
###### You can implement the software process for your project according to a given agile software development method

By utilizing an Agile method that I researched extensively, as seen in the research document [here](Documents/agile.md), and consistently planning and tracking progress in the GitHub environment, I have demonstrated proficiency in this learning outcome.

### CI/CD
###### You implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.

Through conducting research on the appropriate tests for my project and the types of tests available, automating a workflow file to execute my test scripts, testing endpoints with Postman/Swagger, testing integrity of the backend, implementing performance tests, testing the entire CRUD system, and running the backend and database on a Docker network with a Docker Compose, I have demonstrated proficiency in this learning outcome. More about CICD can be found [here](Documents/cicd.md).

### Cultural differences and ethics
###### You recognize and take into account cultural differences when working with multi-site teams, and are aware of ethical aspects in software development

I have conducted research on the topic of Ethics and Culture on its application in the IT industry my own take and experience and based on that, I would currently rate my proficiency in this learning outcome as "Proficient". My research document can be found [here](Documents/cultural-differences-and-ethics.md).

### Requirements and design
###### You translate (non-functional) requirements to extend existing (architectural) designs and can validate them using multiple types of test techniques

By establishing a range of functional and non-functional requirements, creating user stories, and conducting research on the design approach for my project, I believe that I have demonstrated proficiency in this learning outcome. The design research document can be found [here](Documents/ux-research.md).

### Business processes
###### You can explain simple business processes and relate them to the development of your software project.

By conducting appropriate research and creating a business process based on a feature within my Happilly system and having done a workshop about the business processes and usermapping stories I would rate my proficiency in this learning outcome as proficient. More about the business process can be found [here](Documents/business-process.md) and the workshop documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/fontys-open-up/2223nj-db03/tree/main/user-story-mapping-workshop)

### Professional
###### You act in a professional manner during software development and learning

By effectively communicating with stakeholders/coaches to understand their needs, collaborating with team members in a professional manner, and keeping stakeholders/coaches informed of progress through sprints, such as sprint planning , I would rate my proficiency in this learning outcome as proficient. You can view the communication between the stakeholder/coaches and I in FeedPulse.
